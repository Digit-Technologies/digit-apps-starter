# ShipStation template

## What it does

Phase 1 org Sutton app: connect one ShipStation account (V2 key, or V1 key + secret), push Sutton
shipments in **awaiting_carrier** into ShipStation as V2 shipments/`create_sales_order` or V1 orders.
**Scheduled push** sends eligible shipments every five minutes; **Manual push** (the default) sends them
only when an operator clicks Push to ShipStation. Before push, the Sutton shipment must have a
`shippingCarrierField` with a confirmed map to exactly one ShipStation **service** in Carrier configuration;
that carrier and service are sent on the created ShipStation shipment/order. Operators buy the
label in ShipStation (no in-app rate shop). The same five-minute poll (and Pull from ShipStation)
pulls tracking, carrier, and cost back onto the Sutton shipment.
The shipping queue lists awaiting-carrier Sutton shipments and can be filtered by ShipStation tracking status
(`unknown` → Sutton `awaiting_pickup`; `in_transit` / `delivered` / `error` → Sutton `shipped`).
On every load (and when the iframe becomes visible again) the queue re-fetches Sutton
`shipments` (up to 100, in a vertically scrolling table) so the Carrier column, packages,
and Sutton status match Sutton. Each pack container can use a ShipStation package type
from the queue: V2 lists account custom packages and the mapped carrier's packages
(including flat-rate boxes); V1 lists carrier packages only. The choice is stored in D1
and sent on push. It is not written to the Sutton sales order or shipment. After push the
picker locks; pull and the five-minute poll refresh the queue from the ShipStation package.
If the shipment carrier is empty, the table and push path use the sales
order’s current `shippingCarrierField`. Do not alias `shipment(id)` per row — that
exceeds Sutton’s GraphQL cost cap (`QUERY_TOO_EXPENSIVE`).
Operators can download
the PDF from the shipping queue once a label exists. Packing-slip PDFs use Sutton
`Order.shippingFees`, which this app sets from ShipStation label postage on writeback and
again when the slip is downloaded. Sutton `shippingCarrierField` writeback
uses aliases + conservative fuzzy match on the **service** (not the brand), plus carrier-mapping
overrides (service map, then carrier default). Unmatched pulled
services stay unset, appear in a main-page alert, and can be mapped from the Carrier configuration
modal. Operators pick/pack and create the Sutton
shipment first. Return labels, in-app rate shop, shipping-class mapping, and shipping-fee
capture stay out of the UI.

Source for `npm run new-app -- my-app --from shipstation-template`. Connect and sync only
work after a consumer publishes to Sutton (Worker, D1, secrets).

## Data & permissions

- `manifest.permissions`: `UPDATE_ORGANIZATION` (admin gate via `currentPermissions`),
  `READ_ORDER` / `UPDATE_ORDER` / `CREATE_ORDER`,   `READ_SHIPMENT` / `CREATE_SHIPMENT` /
  `UPDATE_SHIPMENT`, `CREATE_PACK_CONTAINER` / `READ_PACK_CONTAINER`, `READ_PICKED_ITEM`,
  `READ_ITEM` / `READ_ITEM_COST_INFO`, `READ_INVENTORY`, `READ_COMPANY` /
  `READ_COMPANY_DETAILS` / `CREATE_COMPANY`, `READ_CONTACT`, `READ_ORGANIZATION_LOCATION`,
  `READ_ORGANIZATION_DYNAMIC_FIELD`.
  Keys from MCP `appPermissions`. The Worker uses `JWT_TOKEN` (a Clerk user JWT) for the
  same operations on the 5-minute poll. **Sutton staff generate this token and place it in
  the organization’s app secrets.** A Settings → API Tokens `da_` key is not sufficient
  (`apiPermissions` has no `UPDATE_SHIPMENT`).
- D1 `SHIPSTATION_DB` — publish binding only (not shown in the UI). `0001_init.sql` plus
  `0002_order_sync.sql`, `0003_app_config.sql`, `0004_activity_log.sql`,
  `0006_api_version.sql`, `0007_drop_legacy_app_secrets.sql`, `0008_shipment_map.sql`,
  `0009_label_rates.sql`, `0010_carrier_digit_map.sql`, `0011_tracking_status.sql`,
  `0012_push_mode.sql`, `0013_carrier_service_map.sql`, `0014_manual_push_default.sql`,
  `0015_activity_log_created_index.sql`, and `0016_package_selection.sql`. Do not edit `0001` after a
  consumer has published.
- **All secrets are organization-level Sutton app secrets**, managed only in Sutton's built-in
  App Secrets UI: `SHIPSTATION_API_KEY`, `SHIPSTATION_API_SECRET` (V1),
  `JWT_TOKEN`. Key alone = V2; key + secret = V1.
  The app never accepts, writes, returns, or logs their values. Sutton injects them into the
  Worker as `env.KEY`. There is **no D1 fallback** for these keys (legacy `app_config` rows
  are deleted on publish via `0007`) so removing a secret in Sutton drops setup progress to
  match. The published app is a template for many organizations, so **no secret is ever
  shared across organizations**. Do not use a `DIGIT_` prefix — Sutton reserves it for
  platform bindings.
- `GET /setup` reports `items[].source` (`appSecret` when live) plus `shipStationApiMode`
  (`v1` | `v2` | `missing`). Setup progress counts **required** items only.
- `POST /connection` no longer takes a key: it reads `SHIPSTATION_API_KEY` (and
  `SHIPSTATION_API_SECRET` for V1), validates with a live carrier list, then creates the local
  connection row (`api_version`) and syncs carriers.
  `api_key_encrypted` is written as `''` for new rows and only read as a
  **legacy V2 fallback** for keys pasted before this switch.
  The auto-generated `ENCRYPTION_KEY` row stays only to decrypt those legacy values.
- There is no operator Disconnect control. Connect replaces a leftover connection row when
  secrets are restored. Removing the ShipStation key itself is done in Sutton.
- Sutton GraphQL URL is always `https://api.digit-software.com/graphql`.
- Optional secret `FAIRE_API_KEY` — enables the Faire adapter stub (`src/backend/channels/faire.js`).
- `GET /setup` is read-only: per-item `present` / `source` / `enables` plus `ready`,
  `usable`, `apiTokenPresent`. `POST /setup` only returns a message
  pointing at Sutton app secrets.
- Partial config is **not** a blocking screen. The app always renders; `FeatureStatus.tsx`
  shows per-feature Working / Limited / Not yet with what each one still needs, and the
  queue's push button is disabled with a reason when `JWT_TOKEN` is not live.
- Org settings: `default_fulfillment_method` is `manual` (the default: Push to ShipStation only)
  or `scheduled` (5-minute outbound push). Default weight (ounces). Carrier maps live in a dedicated modal
  with two tabs: **Sutton carriers → push** (each Sutton option on exactly one confirmed ShipStation
  service) and **ShipStation services → writeback** (one Sutton `shippingCarriers` option per
  ShipStation service, with an optional per-carrier Sutton default).
- Schedule `poll-outbound-push` every 300s (outbound push only when fulfillment method is scheduled, plus unlabeled-map
  label pull). The shipping queue **Pull from ShipStation** button only pulls labels
  via `POST /sync/poll`. Outbound push is **Push to ShipStation** (`POST /sync/push`) or the
  five-minute job when fulfillment method is scheduled.
- Schedule `prune-activity` every 300s. It deletes activity rows older than one calendar
  month, and only during 12:00–12:09 AM Pacific, because the platform has no clock cron.
- **Tracking writeback uses `JWT_TOKEN`.** Sutton staff generate a Clerk JWT and place it
  in the org’s app secrets. That identity has the user’s live permissions, including
  `UPDATE_SHIPMENT`. Settings → API Tokens (`da_`) cannot update shipments. Pull from ShipStation still
  applies staged `pendingWritebacks[]` in the iframe as a fallback when the operator is
  present.
- **Rate limits:** the poll lists Sutton shipments (`awaiting_carrier`) with `SHIPMENT_LIST_QUERY` and hands each node to
  `pushShipment` as `preloaded`, so ineligible shipments cost no extra Sutton query, and a run stops
  after `MAX_PUSHES_PER_RUN` (25). `digitGraphql` retries a 429 twice with backoff (honoring
  `Retry-After`) and then returns "Sutton API rate limit reached". Keep per-order Sutton calls
  out of any loop you add here — that is what caused "Too many requests" before.
- **Gotcha:** Org-admin is UI-only. Anyone who can open the app can hit `/proxy/backend`.
- **Gotcha:** `0001` still has unused rate/label-cost columns. Do not expose them in GET/PATCH
  JSON until a Phase 2 recipe re-adds that UI.

## Prompts

```
Make the following updates:
- Remove leftover secrets (PUBLIC_WEBHOOK_URL, SHIPSTATION_WEBHOOK_TOKEN)
- Ensure that all webhook related functionality is removed from the application
- In org settings
  - Update default fulfillment method to have two options:
    - Scheduled push: Use shipstation api to push from shipment queue every 5 mins
    - Manual push: only push to shipstation on refresh button click
  - Remove Sync mode completely: only offer Sutton to Shipstation workflow
  - Remove any settings that are not currently used by the app like Push and Lane tag ID
  - Remove default package dimensions
```

```
Refactor the ShipStation app so push only creates the shipment/order, operators pick rates
in ShipStation, and tracking/price come back via 5-minute API poll plus an on-demand
Refresh. Remove auto rate-shop and auto-buy labels for V1 and V2. Do not subscribe
ShipStation webhooks on connect.
```

```
Write a plan to take the template app through phase 1 outlined in the markdown pasted
below. Even though the other phases are out of scope, engineer the app with them in mind.
Ideally the app will meet the common needs of customers out of the box but be easily
extendable when pulled into their own llms.
```

```
the plan looks mostly good. But update the template to remove settings that are for phase
two or three. The app ui and usage flow should only meet phase 1 needs.
```

```
also make sure changes to to my forked repository branch called shipstation-template
```

```
Implement the plan as specified, it is attached for your reference. Do NOT edit the plan
file itself.
```

```
I am unable to enter the api token without also entering the webhook url. I want to be
able to set this up one token at a time.
```

```
Allow user to run the app with just the tokens that have been provided. Make it clear
which functionlity is working.
```

```
why doesn't this app use the shipstation api key? Or is that what is saved as
APP_SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY
```

```
Can we programatically add the tokens the the digit app secrets?
```

```
Use the built in digit infrastructure to save tokens rather than the textbox input.
```

```
There is a misunderstanding of how the digit infrastructure works. All Secrets are at the
organization level not the published app. Which is what I want. No secrets should be shared
across the published app. The published app is a template meant to serve many organizations.
Store the shipstation app in the same way that the digit api token and the public webhook
url are stored
```

```

Change the copy in the informational from "These are this organization’s app secrets in
Sutton. Add the missing values under Sutton → Apps → this app → Secrets, then reload. Values
are managed by Sutton and are never entered or shown inside this app." to "These are this

Apps' and then 'Edit' for the ShipStation integration, then reload. Values are managed by
Sutton and are never entered or shown inside this app."
```

```
In the shipstation template consider error handling. Write out a plan to handle errors and
make troubleshooting easier. For example, I clicked "push selected" and the item I had
selected disappeared. The user needs a way to see a log of what actions have been taken
and an indication that the action went through successfully and waht that means. Make
error handling robust and verbose.
```

I want to create a workflow in this template that addresses the following use case.

Our customers use ShipStation to manage shipments. In ShipStation customers are able to save custom package types so they do not have to continually type in the dimensions. Further they have access to carrier specific packages. For example FedEx might offer a box that has a flat rate rather than being priced by dimensions and/or weight. The problem is that a user cannot preconfigure shipping containers or select carrier specific package types using the built in Sutton container selection workflow.

Build a package configuration workflow into the shipment queue. This workflow should pull in the customer saved and carrier specific packaging container types and allow the user to select them as need per package. This does not need to update what is stored in the Sutton Sales order or Shipment object.
```

```
carrier specific packages are not showing up in the dropdown.

The following is from the shipstation api docs:

Yes — the sandbox pre-provisioned carriers do include carrier package types like USPS flat rate boxes. Let me pull your connected carriers to check exactly what's available.The session key is returning 401 so I can't pull your specific carrier list directly. Here's what you need to know:

Yes, carrier packages are available in sandbox. Pre-provisioned sandbox carriers — including USPS via stamps_com — support carrier-defined package types like:

USPS flat rate boxes (small, medium, large)
USPS flat rate envelopes (regular, legal, padded)
USPS regional rate boxes (A, B)
FedEx and UPS carrier packaging if those carriers are pre-provisioned on your account
To see the full list for your sandbox carriers, call GET /v1/carriers/{carrier_id}/packages — it returns every package type supported by that carrier.

Once you have your carrier IDs (from GET /v1/carriers), the packages endpoint will show the package_code values you use when creating labels, for example flat_rate_box, flat_rate_envelope, etc.
```

```
make sure that carriers are re pulled on refresh
```

```
add to the activity log when app pulls in new carriers and packages from shipstation
```

```
Also include API updates to Sutton objects like SOs and SHPs
```

```
Indicate that packages types are loading in the drop down. Currently it makes it look like there are no carrier package types.
```

## Context supplied

- Work stays on git branch `shipstation-template` tracking `fork/shipstation-template`
  (`loren-wolfe/digit-apps-starter`). Do not push to upstream `origin` unless asked.
- Phase 1: COM-01–COM-08 plus CS-12/13/14/16 and CS-01 as a Faire recipe/stub.
- Strip FR-3 return-email, address-block, and shipping-fee capture from UI and Worker JSON.
  Leave unused `0001` connection columns at SQL defaults. Default package weight lives on
  `org_settings` (`0009_label_rates.sql`). Do not auto rate-shop or buy labels from Sutton.
- Sutton native pick/pack/PDF; operators create a Sutton shipment (`awaiting_carrier`). The shipping
  queue lists awaiting-carrier, unknown (`awaiting_pickup`), and in-transit/delivered (`shipped`)
  Sutton shipments (filter by mapped ShipStation `tracking_status`). Worker push is V2
  `POST /v2/shipments` with `create_sales_order: true`, or V1 `POST /orders/createorder`,
  and always includes the mapped ShipStation carrier + service from the Sutton shipment’s
  `shippingCarrierField`. Shipments without a mapped Sutton carrier are not pushed.
  Operators buy labels in ShipStation. Poll/`POST /sync/poll` uses `GET /v2/labels` (V2) or
  `GET /orders/{id}` (V1) then Sutton writeback. Shipping-label download uses `POST /sync/label`;
  packing-slip download uses `POST /sync/packing-slip`, where the Worker calls
  `generateSalesOrderPdf`, fetches the presigned PDF URL outside the iframe CSP, and returns
  base64. Both finish with `DigitHost.download`. This app does not register or receive
  ShipStation webhooks. Sutton `shippingCarrierFieldId` is set from the ShipStation service on
  writeback (service map, then carrier default, then service-string auto-match). Pulled labels
  whose service still does not resolve show a warning on the main page.
- `JWT_TOKEN` because the scheduled poll has no iframe Sutton session. Sutton staff generate
  this Clerk JWT and place it in the organization’s app secrets. Do not use `da_` API tokens.

```
why am I getting this error in the app:
"Writing ShipStation label se-200223533 back to Sutton failed: [NOT_AUTHORIZED] User is not
authorized to access updateShipment on Mutation"
```

- Cause: `apiPermissions` (API-token scopes) offers `READ_SHIPMENT` but no `UPDATE_SHIPMENT` /
  `CREATE_SHIPMENT`, while `appPermissions` has all three. The Worker writeback used the token,
  so it could never succeed. Fix: poll stages the label as `label_ready` + `pendingWritebacks[]`,
  the frontend runs `updateShipment` on the operator's session, then `POST
  /sync/writeback-complete`.

```
Change the api token secret to JWT_TOKEN and make a note that Sutton staff will have to
generate this token and place it in the account for the user
```

- Rename `API_TOKEN_DIGIT` → `JWT_TOKEN`. Sutton staff generate a Clerk JWT and store it as
  that org app secret. Do not use Settings → API Tokens (`da_`).

```
Pull in carrier information in the following ways.
- Use carrier chip on the main page as a button click to pop up a carrier settings modal.
- Put carrier mapping in that modal. Rework the UI to make it more clear which Shipstation carriers are being matched.
- Show alert if there is a carrier being pulled in that doesn't match.
```

- Carrier count in the command bar is a chip that opens a dedicated mapping modal (org admins).
  Each ShipStation carrier shows name, code, Sutton match, and Auto/Manual/Unmatched. Pulled
  label carriers that still do not resolve are listed separately, warned on the main page, and
  omitted from `unmappedCarriers` once they match or are mapped. Fulfillment method and default
  weight stay in Settings. Creating Sutton carrier options is out of scope.

```
testing shows that there are two unmatched but no alert to the user. Show a little red alert
icon on the chip to let users know mapping is needed.
```

- The alert counted only `unmappedCarriers` (carriers seen on a purchased label), so synced
  carriers with no Sutton match showed Unmatched in the modal with no page alert. The chip and
  alert now key off every `ssCarriers[]` row without a `digitOptionId`; the chip turns red with
  an error icon and tooltip. A carrier already used on a label escalates the alert to `error`
  ("those shipments have no Sutton carrier"); otherwise it is a `warning`. When
  `digitCarriersError` is set, unmatched state is suppressed (nothing can match) and the load
  error itself is shown on the page.

```
Make the carrier mapping UI tighter. Consider a more table like format
```

- The modal is a dense MUI `Table` (ShipStation / Sutton shipping carrier / Match) instead of
  stacked cards, with a `mapped of total` count. Rows sort unmatched-first by server state so
  they do not jump while editing. Catalog and label-only carriers share one table; label-only
  rows are tagged `from label` under the code. `TablePagination` appears past 10 rows.

```
The carrier matching feature needs to take into account that Sutton considers different services offered by a carrier as unique carriers.

The following describes how shipstation handles this:
Shipping service (ground, air, express, etc.) is selected via the service_code field on your shipment.

Every carrier has its own set of service codes. You set one service_code per shipment, and it determines the speed, price, and handling. Common examples:

UPS

ups_ground — standard ground delivery
ups_2nd_day_air — 2-day air
ups_next_day_air — overnight
ups_next_day_air_saver — overnight, cheaper cutoff
ups_worldwide_express — international express
FedEx

fedex_ground — standard ground
fedex_home_delivery — residential ground
fedex_2day — 2-day air
fedex_priority_overnight — next day by 10:30am
fedex_standard_overnight — next day by 3pm
fedex_international_priority — international express
USPS (via Stamps.com)

usps_priority_mail — 1–3 days
usps_priority_mail_express — overnight/2-day
usps_ground_advantage — standard ground/parcel

 Outline how to reconcile this in the carrier config modal
```

- Mapping grain is ShipStation **service** (`service_code`) → Sutton `shippingCarriers`.
  Resolution: manual service map, then manual carrier default, then auto-match on the
  service name/code with a brand gate (never `stamps_com` → `USPS`). The modal filters by
  ShipStation carrier, has a Default Sutton carrier control, and a service table. Chip/alert
  count unmatched services. `carrier_digit_map` unique is
  `(connection_id, ss_carrier_code, ss_service_code)` (`0013`). Label pull stores
  `service_code` / `service_name` on the order map. Sutton `shippingClass` is not written.

```
Make some minor ui updates to shipstation template:
- Move the "connected" and "disconnect" chips to be on the left had side of the page to make it clearer that we are talking about a shipstation connection
- Make the carriers chip more obviously clickable. Rename to Carrier configuration.
- Move the digit status dropdown filter to be more integrated with the queue. Same with Refresh.
- Change "Refresh" button to "Pull from Shipstation"
```

- `ConnectionBar` splits into a connection cluster (title, status chip) on the left and org
  actions (Setup and capabilities, Carrier configuration, Settings, Connect) on the right.
  Status now always renders a chip, including the admin-with-key "Not connected" case that
  previously showed only the Connect button.
- The carrier chip is an outlined `Button` (truck icon, `error` color plus count when services
  are unmapped) labeled **Carrier configuration**, matching the modal title.
- The queue's Sutton status filter and pull action moved out of `SectionHeader` into a
  `queueToolbar` row directly above the table, above the sticky push bar.
- **Refresh** is **Pull from ShipStation** (`Pulling…` while polling) everywhere it is named:
  queue notices, tooltips, eligibility copy, `FeatureStatus`, org-settings hints, and the
  Worker's activity-log and push messages. The route (`POST /sync/poll`) and the
  `source: 'refresh'` activity value are unchanged.

```
Actually remove the disconnect button completely. No one should have to disconnect their account.
```

- Removed the Disconnect / Clear connection button from `ConnectionBar`, the confirm
  dialog, and the credentials-missing Clear connection action. Operators restore
  `SHIPSTATION_API_KEY` and click Connect; Connect already retires the previous D1
  connection row. `DELETE /connection` remains on the Worker but is unused by the UI.

```
Flesh out the Sutton -> Shipstation and Shipstation -> Sutton workflows. Use the
shipstation mcp to learn about the shipstation api when needed.

Confirm functionality that is already there and write a plan to implement the rest.

Before pushing to Shipstation the customer needs a way to either select a carrier
and service or to select that they want to use rate shopping. If they haven't
selected to use rate shopping and a carrier/service are not selected an error
should be rised and push to shipstation should be prevented. If a carrier is
selected in digit that is not mapped to shipstation an error should be raised
and push should be blocked.
```

```
actually flesh out this workflow with no rate shopping selected. Is anything
missing. Outline the steps to test the workflow
```

```
Sutton ↔ ShipStation workflows (no rate shopping)

Implement the plan as specified, it is attached for your reference. Do NOT edit
the plan file itself.
```

- Rate shopping stays out of scope. Push requires a Sutton `shippingCarrierField`
  that reverse-maps via a **service-level** `carrier_digit_map` row to exactly one
  ShipStation carrier + service. Missing, unmapped, or ambiguous Sutton carriers
  are eligibility skips (Blocked; checkbox off). V2 create sends `carrier_id` +
  `service_code`; V1 createorder sends `carrierCode` + `serviceCode`. Carrier
  defaults (`ss_service_code = ''`) do not satisfy push. Queue shows a Carrier
  column from Sutton. Writeback SS → Sutton is unchanged.

```
Change the pull to shipstation button to Push/Pull Shipstation (confirm that it
pushes before doing this)
```

- `POST /sync/poll` already ran outbound push before the label pull, so the queue
  button is **Push/Pull Shipstation** (`Pushing/Pulling…`) and every in-app string
  that named the click follows it.

```
I added a new carrier that was designed to cause a failure. When I refreshed the
app I wasn't alerted that there was a new, mismatched carrier. It was hard for me
to find in the modal ui. It also did not block the push
```

- Push now needs a **confirmed** map: only `source = 'manual'` service rows satisfy
  `resolveSsServiceFromDigitOption`. Auto-persisted `fuzzy` rows resolve to the new
  `unconfirmed` status and block push until a human picks the service.
- `/org-settings` returns `digitCarrierMaps[]` — one row per Sutton shipping carrier
  with `status` (`ok` | `unmapped` | `unconfirmed` | `ambiguous`) and the resolved SS
  carrier/service. The main page shows an **error** alert naming every Sutton carrier
  that cannot push, and the Carrier configuration chip counts push gaps plus
  writeback gaps.
- Carrier configuration shows one row per Sutton option with a grouped
  ShipStation-service picker and a Ready/Confirm/Not mapped chip. Picking a service
  clears that option's other pins so it stays one-to-one.
- Sweep runs no longer swallow blocks: `pollOutboundPush` pushes as the real actor,
  returns `blocked` + `blockedShipments[]`, logs attention-worthy skips to the
  activity log, and the queue notice lists each blocked shipment with its next step.
  Routine skips (already pushed, already shipped, imported) stay quiet.

```
remove writeback for now but keep the logic. It won't be needed until rate shopping
is added
```

- The ShipStation-services → Sutton-carrier writeback mapping tab, its unmatched-service
  alert, and its count in the Carrier configuration button are hidden for now. The
  backend payload, matching helpers, saved mappings, and label writeback behavior remain
  intact for later rate-shopping work. Carrier configuration now exposes only the
  Sutton-carrier → ShipStation-service mapping required to push.

```
make manual pushing/pulling shipstation the default
```

- `normalizeFulfillmentMethod` and org-settings reads treat anything other than explicit
  `scheduled` as `manual`. Settings lists Manual first. Migration `0014_manual_push_default.sql`
  sets existing org rows to `manual` so the five-minute job no longer auto-pushes; it still
  pulls labels. Scheduled remains an opt-in in Settings.

```
My bad - only have the app push to shipstation when push to shipstation is pressed.
The other button should say pull from shipstation like before.
```

- Queue **Push to ShipStation** (`POST /sync/push`) is the only operator path that creates
  ShipStation shipments. **Pull from ShipStation** (`POST /sync/poll`) pulls labels only.
  The five-minute job still pulls labels, and still pushes only when fulfillment method is
  scheduled.

```
the shipstation template queue doesn't repopulate the carrier when it is changed. This table should pull fresh digit information automatically on load.
```

- The shipping queue re-fetches Sutton `shipments` on load and whenever
  the iframe becomes visible again. Display, eligibility, and push use the shipment
  `shippingCarrierField` when set, otherwise the parent sales order’s current carrier.

```
Showing an error even though the table updates correctly:
Support info
code=QUERY_TOO_EXPENSIVE kind=platform detail=Query exceeds the maximum allowed cost.
```

- Removed the aliased `shipment(shipmentId:)` hydrate of every visible row. That second
  query exceeded Sutton’s GraphQL cost cap while the list query already had the updated
  carrier. Freshness is the list refetch on load/visible plus the order-carrier fallback.

```
make sure the cost gets applied to the packing slip
```

- Label postage (`shipment_cost`) is written to Sutton `Order.shippingFees` (`CostInput`)
  on writeback and again immediately before `generateSalesOrderPdf`, so the packing slip
  PDF includes ShipStation shipping cost. Multi-shipment orders sum D1 label costs.

```
make sure all the status chips are clearly visible. For example, "blocked" is not easy to see.
```

- Status chips are filled (not outlined) with theme contrast text and heavier labels so
  Blocked, Ready, Sutton/tracking, connection, setup, and carrier-mapping states stay readable.

```
keep the hover over that explained why a package is blocked
```

- Hovering **Blocked** (and the disabled select checkbox) still shows the ineligibility
  reason and next step. StatusChip forwards Tooltip mouse/focus listeners so the hover
  is not dropped.

```
shipping queue is cut off and paginated. Have it scroll vertically rather than paginate. Try and fit it to the page better.

Also center the files icon to the rows that it is referencing
```

- The shipping queue fills the iframe: table body scrolls vertically (no Previous/Next).
  Files icons are vertically centered on the row and stay sticky on the right.

```
The packing slip does not map the correct carrier to the slip. Make sure that the slip carrier matches the SHP and shipstation carrier
```

- The sales-order packing slip prints `Order.shippingCarrierField`. Before
  `generateSalesOrderPdf`, the purchased ShipStation label is read again and that
  field is set from the label’s mapped Sutton option. The SHP field is only used
  when the label does not resolve, because it can still be the carrier chosen on
  the sales order before the label was bought.

```
the packing slip is still showing fedex
```

- Downloading the slip was copying the SHP’s original FedEx option back onto the
  order. The slip now uses the carrier and service on the purchased label. V1
  orders use the label shipment’s carrier, not the carrier sent at push.

```
Make the Activity Log in the shipstation template more robust.

- User needs to be able to expand it or click to another tab for it
- It should be filterable by type (error, success, warning)
- It should be searchable by date/time/text
- It should be very clear if the error came from Sutton vs Shipstation
```

- The queue keeps a short activity preview with Expand. The Activity tab is the
  full log: type filters (warnings include skipped), search across date, time,
  and text, and a banner on errors and warnings that names Sutton or ShipStation.
  `origin` is derived when the log is read, so older rows get the same label.

```
Remove the log at the bottom of the page and just keep the activity log tab
```

- The queue no longer shows an activity preview. The Activity tab is the only log.

```
Improve the UI of the activity log entries. Show exact error message if there is one. I especially do not like the way that it shows "Shipstation has no update for this shipment"
```

- Entries show the stored message, plus a detail `message` when it is not already
  included. Sutton or ShipStation is a chip. The log no longer adds its own
  sentence in place of that text.

```
instead of a chip that says "this app" have it say "In app" and make it a charcoal grey chip
```

- Events recorded by this template use an “In app” chip in charcoal grey.

```
The activity log should only hold onto entries up to 1 month old. Auto delete entries as they surupass this age every day at 12 AM.
```

- `prune-activity` deletes `activity_log` rows older than one calendar month. The job is
  scheduled every five minutes and performs the delete only from midnight to 12:09 AM
  Pacific.
