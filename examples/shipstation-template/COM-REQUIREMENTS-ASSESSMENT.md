# ShipStation Template — COM Requirements Assessment

**App:** Digit ShipStation integration template (Phase 1)  
**Date:** September 2026  
**Scope:** COM-01 through COM-08

---

## Summary

The template delivers a Phase 1 integration: operators pick and pack in Digit, push eligible orders to ShipStation for label purchase, and receive tracking writeback when labels are created. It meets the core outbound/inbound sync story for most customers out of the box, with a few gaps where behavior depends on Digit platform features or org configuration.

| Verdict | Requirements |
| --- | --- |
| **Met** | COM-06, COM-07, COM-08 |
| **Mostly met** | COM-01, COM-02 |
| **Platform-dependent / partial** | COM-03, COM-04, COM-05 |

---

## Requirement-by-requirement

### COM-01 — Order push: Digit → ShipStation

**Verdict: Mostly met**

When a sales order is eligible, the app pushes it to ShipStation with ship-to address, line items (SKU + quantity), and order reference ID (`external_shipment_id` / `shipment_number`).

| Spec element | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Ship-to, SKUs, quantities, order reference | ✅ Implemented |
| Manual push | ✅ “Push selected” in fulfillment queue |
| Automatic push on fulfillable | ⚠️ 5-minute scheduled poll, not real-time status change |
| Fulfillable = inventory + production complete | ⚠️ Inventory gate yes; default also requires **fully packed** unless org setting is changed to “inventory available”; no explicit production-complete check |

---

### COM-02 — Fulfillment writeback: ShipStation → Digit

**Verdict: Mostly met**

When ShipStation creates a label, webhooks trigger writeback to Digit: tracking number, carrier (in shipment notes), ship date, and shipment status set to shipped.

| Spec element | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Tracking number | ✅ Written to Digit shipment |
| Carrier name | ✅ Written to shipment notes |
| Ship date | ✅ Written as `dropOffDate` |
| Shipment cost | ⚠️ Stored in app database only — not written to Digit |
| Sales order status → shipped | ⚠️ App updates **shipment** status; order-level status relies on Digit cascading |

---

### COM-03 — Tracking propagation: Digit → sales channel

**Verdict: Partial / platform-dependent**

After writeback, channel notification is **not implemented in this app**. The template assumes Digit’s Rutter integration pushes fulfillments to connected commerce channels (Shopify, etc.) once tracking is on the Digit shipment. A Faire adapter exists as an extension stub only.

**Prerequisite for COM-03:** Rutter (or channel-specific adapters) configured in Digit.

---

### COM-04 — Pick list generation

**Verdict: Met via Digit platform, not this app**

Pick lists are generated and executed in **Digit’s native UI**. The app displays pick status in the fulfillment queue but does not generate pick lists or pick-list PDFs.

---

### COM-05 — Packing slip generation

**Verdict: Partial**

Packing is performed in Digit. The app offers a **sales order PDF** download from the queue (line items and order reference are on the Digit document). There is no dedicated packing-slip PDF in the template.

---

### COM-06 — Label printing in ShipStation

**Verdict: Met**

By design: eligible orders are pushed to ShipStation; operators select carriers, rate-shop, and print labels in ShipStation. Label purchase inside Digit is explicitly out of scope (Phase 2).

---

### COM-07 — Manual order entry

**Verdict: Met**

Users create sales orders manually in Digit (phone, email, etc.). Any eligible order can be pushed to ShipStation via manual push or the scheduled poll. No channel-origin restriction.

---

### COM-08 — Inventory gate

**Verdict: Met**

Only orders with sufficient available inventory (`fully_available` on all remaining lines) are eligible for push. Orders without inventory are skipped with a clear reason and remain in the queue.

---

## Intended workflow (Phase 1)

```
Digit                          ShipStation                    Sales channel
─────                          ───────────                    ─────────────
Create / receive SO
Pick & pack (native)
Push when eligible      ──►    Rate shop & print label
                        ◄──    Webhook: label created
Update Digit shipment
(Rutter / adapters)     ──────────────────────────────►    Tracking & fulfillment
```

---

## Gaps to close for strict COM compliance

1. **Event-driven push** — Replace or supplement the 5-minute poll with real-time triggers when orders become fulfillable.
2. **Shipment cost writeback** — Persist label cost on the Digit shipment (or order), not only in the app database.
3. **Channel propagation** — Document Rutter as a hard prerequisite, or implement channel adapters (Shopify, Faire, etc.) in the app.
4. **Documents** — Clarify or add dedicated pick-list and packing-slip outputs if sales order PDF is insufficient.

## Configuration notes

| Setting | Default | Effect on COM-01 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `push_when` | `fully_packed` | Push after packing complete |
| `push_when` | `inventory_available` | Push when inventory can fill the order |
| `sync_mode` | `digit_to_ss` | Outbound push enabled |
| Scheduled poll | Every 300s | Automatic push for newly eligible orders |

**Required secrets:** `SHIPSTATION_API_KEY`, `API_TOKEN_DIGIT`, `PUBLIC_WEBHOOK_URL` (for real-time writeback).
