  Build and publish Digit custom apps (React + MUI + Digit theme via
  @digit/lib-frontend, optional Cloudflare Worker backends via @digit/lib-backend,
  Vite IIFE bundles, manifest.json, Digit API proxy, env/secrets). Apps run in a
  locked-down sandboxed iframe (no downloads, popups, browser dialogs, clipboard,
  or device APIs). Use when creating a new Digit app, editing an app whose
  source is already on disk (in-app agent or after update-digit-app), packing,
  or publishing via MCP. Do not use as the first step to change a published
  app from a fresh MCP workspace (use update-digit-app). Also when the user
  mentions Digit apps, manifest.json, DigitProxyClient, DigitThemeProvider,
  /proxy/digit, or /proxy/backend.

# Create Digit App

Build Digit custom apps that run inside Digit as **sandboxed iframes** with a locked-down
Permissions Policy. Follow this skill end-to-end — do not invent alternate layouts,
mount targets, stacks, or publish flows, and do not build features the iframe cannot
support (downloads, new tabs/popups, browser dialogs, clipboard, camera, etc.).
See [reference/iframe-constraints.md](reference/iframe-constraints.md).

**Default stack (required):** React + MUI + `@digit/lib-frontend` (`DigitThemeProvider`).
Do not build vanilla HTML/CSS UI, invent a parallel design system, or skip the theme
package. Users are often non-developers — one path keeps apps looking and behaving
like Digit.

**Digit MCP is required.** Use it for schema lookup, permissions, listing apps, and
publish. If MCP is not connected, stop and ask the user to connect Digit MCP before
continuing.

## When to use

- Creating a new Digit app from scratch
- Editing an app whose source is **already** on disk (in-app agent sandbox, or
  after update-digit-app restored the publish)
- Adapting one of the `examples/` templates
- Declaring `manifest.json` permissions / backend
- Calling the Digit GraphQL API from an app
- Using app env vars or secrets (backend only)
- Publishing via Digit MCP tools

Changing a **published** app from a **fresh MCP workspace** (no live `project/`
on disk): follow **update-digit-app** first (MCP user skill; not in the in-app
starter zip), then return here. Digit’s in-app agent already has that tree —
skip update-digit-app.

## Digit MCP (apps)

| Need | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Public GraphQL schema | MCP resources `graphql-schema://index`, `graphql-schema://type/{TypeName}`, `graphql-schema://search/{query}` |
| Manifest permissions | MCP tool **`appPermissions`** — put each permission’s **`key`** in `manifest.json` |
| Find an existing app’s id | MCP tool **`apps`** |
| Publish | **`generateAppUploadLink`** → HTTP POST zip → **`publishApp`** → poll **`appPublish`** |

There are **no** MCP tools to create, update, or delete apps, or to manage env/secrets —
those stay in the Digit UI. Do not invent them.

Do **not** load the full GraphQL schema into context. Use the schema resources above when
writing or changing Digit API operations. Details:
[reference/proxy-and-api.md](reference/proxy-and-api.md),
[reference/permissions.md](reference/permissions.md).

## Quick workflow

Copy this checklist and track progress:

```
Digit app progress:
- [ ] 1. Use the starter's apps/app, or scaffold apps/<name> for an additional app
- [ ] 2. Confirm the user created the app in Digit (get appId via apps)
- [ ] 3. Implement frontend (React + MUI + DigitThemeProvider → #root)
- [ ] 4. Add src/backend/ only if env/secrets or server logic needed
- [ ] 5. Look up GraphQL via graphql-schema://… and permissions via appPermissions
- [ ] 6. Write root manifest.json (permissions[].key from appPermissions)
- [ ] 7. Check manifest.permissions against appPermissions — confirm it covers every Digit API call the app makes
- [ ] 8. Write/update SPEC.md
- [ ] 9. npm run pack -w apps/<name> → app.zip
- [ ] 10. Publish via MCP (upload zip out-of-band)
- [ ] 11. Keep app source under apps/ — not build outputs; no upstream PRs
```

Schema and permission lookup (steps 5–7) must happen **before publish**. Do them as soon
as you know which Digit API calls the app makes — inventing fields or permission strings
fails at runtime or publish validation. Re-check step 7 whenever you add or change a Digit
API call.

### 1. Scaffold the app

This repo is a single **npm workspace**. Apps live in `apps/<name>` — that depth is
required, because apps depend on the libraries via `file:../../packages/*`.

The curated starter archive already contains `apps/app`, pre-scaffolded from the
frontend-only `examples/hello-world` without build outputs. Use it for a **new**
app (no successful publish yet). Add `src/backend/` only when the app needs
server-side functionality. Run `new-app` only when adding another app workspace:

```bash
npm install                     # once per clone, from the repo root
npm run new-app -- my-app       # copies examples/full-featured → apps/my-app
```

`new-app` copies the template, renames the package, writes a `SPEC.md` stub, and re-runs
`npm install` so the workspace links the new app. Trim what you don't need from the copy —
do not invent a new project shape.

The template covers theme, errors, Digit GraphQL (`useDigitApiQuery`), public API + secrets
+ D1 via the Worker (`useBackendQuery` / `@digit/lib-backend`), and env config. Keep the
`@digit/lib-build` devDependency and `"pack": "digit-app pack"` — do **not** add Vite
configs, a local pack script, or a per-app `npm install`.

**Always install from the repo root.** `@digit/lib-build` is a `file:` link, so npm puts
its build toolchain (Vite) in the root `node_modules`, not the app's. Running `npm install`
only inside `apps/<name>` leaves Vite missing and `pack` fails.

All apps share React + MUI + `@digit/lib-frontend` and the same folder conventions.
There is no local Digit preview (Worker / env / D1 are platform-injected) — pack + publish
is the path.

### 2. App must already exist in Digit

Publishing **never creates** an app. Ask the user to create the app in the Digit UI first,
then resolve its `id` with MCP **`apps`** (or have the user paste it).

### 3. Project layout

```
apps/my-app/
├── package.json            # @digit/lib-* ; "pack": "digit-app pack"
├── manifest.json           # staged at zip root by digit-app pack
├── SPEC.md
├── src/frontend/           # main.tsx → #root + DigitThemeProvider; App.tsx
├── src/backend/            # optional Worker (index.js, migrations/)
├── frontend/               # BUILD — gitignored; frontend/index.js entry
└── backend/                # BUILD when Worker present — gitignored
```

Edit `src/frontend` and `src/backend` only. Harness types come from `@digit/lib-frontend`
— no local `digit.d.ts`. Prefer data hooks over calling `window.DigitProxyClient`.

```bash
npm run pack -w apps/my-app     # from repo root → app.zip
```

`app.zip` has root `manifest.json`, `frontend/` (+ `backend/` when declared), and
`project/` (source + vendored `@digit/lib-*`). Digit deploys `frontend/` / `backend/`
only; still upload the zip **unchanged**. Details:
[reference/manifest.md](reference/manifest.md), [reference/publish.md](reference/publish.md).

### 4. Frontend rules

- **Iframe limits (hard):** Apps run under
  `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"` and a Permissions Policy that sets
  camera, clipboard, fullscreen, geolocation, mic, and related features to `'none'`.
  **Never** implement downloads, `window.open` / `target="_blank"`, browser
  `alert`/`confirm`/`prompt`, or device/clipboard/fullscreen APIs — they will not
  work. In-page MUI Dialog/Drawer/Snackbar are fine. Full list:
  [reference/iframe-constraints.md](reference/iframe-constraints.md).
- **Stack:** React + MUI + `DigitThemeProvider`. Prefer theme palette / typography over
  hard-coded colors or custom CSS. See [reference/theming.md](reference/theming.md).
- **Mount to `#root`.** Do not create a different root id or remove `#root`.
- **Wrap the tree** with `DigitThemeProvider` in `main.tsx` (see the template).
- **Entry is IIFE `frontend/index.js`.** `@digit/lib-build` packs it — no alternate bundler.
- **Digit API:** `useDigitApiQuery` / `useDigitApiMutation`. Look up operations via
  `graphql-schema://…` first. Never call Digit GraphQL with a bearer token from the browser.
- **Sort / filter / page via the API:** When the GraphQL field (or backend route) accepts
  sort, filter, or connection/page inputs, use those — do not fetch a full list and
  sort/filter client-side when the API can do it. Confirm arg names via
  `graphql-schema://…`.
- **Tables need pagination:** Any MUI `Table` (or equivalent list of many rows) must be
  paginated — e.g. `connection: { first, after }` / page size + next/previous — not an
  unbounded dump of nodes.
- **Backend:** `useBackendQuery` / `useBackendMutation` — do not hand-roll `/proxy/backend`.
- **Public surface:** hooks + theme + `AppErrorAlert` only. Pair hook `error` with
  `AppErrorAlert` (`onRetry` when retryable) — do not branch on `AppErrorCode` in UI.

### 5. `manifest.json`

Keep it at the **project root**. Pack stages it at the zip root.

No `name`, no `entryFile`, no `compatibilityFlags` — display name lives on the app in
Digit; entries are conventions (`frontend/index.js`, `backend/index.js`).

```json
{
  "permissions": [],
  "backend": {
    "kind": "cloudflare-worker",
    "bindings": { "MY_APP_DB": "database" }
  }
}
```

Omit `backend` when the app is UI-only / Digit API only. `bindings` maps
`BINDING_NAME` → `"database"` (one D1 per app) or `"bucket"` (an R2 bucket for
file/blob storage, max 10). Names are `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` and must not start with
`DIGIT_`.

Optional `backend.schedules` and on-demand jobs:
[reference/jobs-and-schedules.md](reference/jobs-and-schedules.md).
Optional `backend.webhooks` — public inbound POST endpoints at `/webhooks/{path}`; the
handler MUST verify the provider's signature over the raw bytes:
[reference/webhooks.md](reference/webhooks.md).
Full schema: [reference/manifest.md](reference/manifest.md).

### 6. Permissions

`permissions` is the **ceiling** for `/proxy/digit`. Digit intersects it with the viewing
user’s live permissions at runtime.

1. Call MCP **`appPermissions`**
2. Put each needed permission’s **`key`** into `manifest.permissions`
3. Never invent strings — unknown keys fail publish
4. Before pack/publish (checklist step 7), re-read `manifest.permissions` against
   **`appPermissions`** and the app’s Digit API calls — add any missing keys; drop unused
   ones only when you are sure nothing still needs them

Look up GraphQL fields with `graphql-schema://…`, then declare only the permissions those
operations need. Details: [reference/permissions.md](reference/permissions.md).

### 7. Env vars and secrets

Configured on the app in the Digit UI. Injected only into the Worker as `env.KEY`. Read
with `requireEnv` / `optionalEnv` inside `createHandler`. Frontend never embeds secrets —
read env-backed data via backend hooks.
[reference/backend-env-secrets.md](reference/backend-env-secrets.md).

### 8. Publish via MCP

```
apps → generateAppUploadLink → POST zip to uploadUrl → publishApp → poll appPublish
```

The zip does **not** travel through MCP. If you cannot HTTP POST the zip, stop and tell the
user. Run `npm run pack`, then upload **`app.zip` unchanged**.
Full steps: [reference/publish.md](reference/publish.md).

### 9. SPEC.md and local source

Update `SPEC.md` before pack — iteration context for the next agent (purpose, why each
permission/env exists, verbatim prompts, context supplied). Model:
[`examples/full-featured/SPEC.md`](../../../examples/full-featured/SPEC.md).
Details: [reference/spec.md](reference/spec.md).

Keep `apps/<name>/` source on disk. Do not commit build outputs or open PRs against this
upstream starter.

## Decision guide

| Need | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Any new app | Copy `full-featured`, delete unused tabs/routes |
| Change a published app (fresh MCP workspace) | **update-digit-app** (MCP skill, not in the starter zip), then this skill |
| Change a published app (in-app agent) | This skill on the sandbox tree — do not download |
| Digit GraphQL | Schema resources → hooks + `appPermissions` → `key` in manifest |
| Env / secrets / D1 / third-party HTTP | Worker + `@digit/lib-backend` |
| Codes / JSON validation | `@digit/lib-common` |

## Packages (`lib-*`)

Import from each package **root only**. Helpers use **named arguments**. Runtime packages
do **not** re-export each other. Use `@digit/lib-build` only via `npm run pack`.

| Package | When | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@digit/lib-frontend` | Always | Theme, harness types, data hooks, `AppErrorAlert` |
| `@digit/lib-backend` | Worker | `createHandler`, `backendPath`, `ok`/`err`, `requireEnv`, jobs |
| `@digit/lib-common` | With Worker (or code branching) | `AppErrorCode`, result types, validation |
| `@digit/lib-build` | Always (devDependency) | `digit-app pack` |

### Backend Worker

Always wrap with `createHandler`. Strip `/proxy/backend` via `backendPath`, match
`method` + `path`, return `ok` / `err`. Prefer `requireEnv` over reading `env.KEY`.
Jobs/schedules: `createHandler({ jobs })` + `digitJobs({ env })` —
[reference/jobs-and-schedules.md](reference/jobs-and-schedules.md). Webhooks:
`createHandler({ webhooks })`, verify with `verifyWebhookSignature` before acting —
[reference/webhooks.md](reference/webhooks.md). SQL migrations:
[reference/d1-migrations.md](reference/d1-migrations.md).

See `examples/full-featured/src/backend/index.js` for the reference layout.
